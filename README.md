# ai-intel-simpsimp

Welcome to my smortest and secured chatbot, hope you guys go easy on him. Below is a quick documentation about this library.

## APIs

Currently, there are only 2 supported modules that allow you to chat with my SimpSimp bot and teach him to be nicer (i believe).

### chat

In this feature, you can simply chat with my SimpSimp bot in 4 different languages which are: **vietnamese (vn), english (en), chinese (zh)** and my favorite language **rushian (ru)**.

### teach

I integrated this feature allowing visitors to teach my bot with a question - answer set means that you can teach him more than 1 question - answer set at a time.

## configuration

Before hand, you need to have a `config.php` file including original SimSimi's API token so that my library can use it, the content is as below.

```php
<?php

return array(
    "St9LCoAioxTr-FFRydzge6uVupg0gog2" => "5Znnspk5k7HlzIdx3tFfQvArp~iAuZLyVcjY0Tlh"
);

?>
```

In the demo, i will generate the API so you are free to use it.

## installation

To use my library. Firstly, you need to create a new directory with a `composer.json` file including the content below.

```json
{
    "minimum-stability": "dev"
}
```

Then simply run this command then you are good to go.

```
composer require eejay/ai-intel-simpsimp
```

## usage

```php
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$proxy = 'localhost:8080'; // this can be blank if you don't want to use proxy
$config = '/tmp/config.php';

$a = new \Eejay\Controllers\Api($proxy);
$rep = $a->chat($config, 'xin chÃ o', 'vn');

$arr = 'a%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A3%3A%221%2B1%22%3Bs%3A17%3A%22hoi+z+cung+hoi%3F%3F%3F%22%3B%7D';

$rep2 = $a->teach($arr);

echo $rep;
echo $rep2;

```

## extra

There is a custom option that allows whoever wants to develop my project can use that is you can do stuffs such as garbage cleaning or closing database connection, etc... before destroy your object.
